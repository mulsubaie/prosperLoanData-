# prosperLoanData-

## Dataset

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

In my investigation, I discovered a negative correlation between the borrower APR and the original loan amount. 
The APR gets less as the loan amount grows and with the highest Prosper ratings.Persons with lower ratings often borrow less money 
and for borrowers with HR-C rates, the borrower APR decreased as the borrow time lengthened. However, the APR rises as the length 
of the loan increases for borrowers with B-AA grades.


## Key Insights for Presentation

I only concentrate on the original loan amount and BrrowerAPR,I began by displaying the distribution borrower APR,
then I looked the relationship between borrower APR and Loan Amount by displaying the distribution of the variable loan amount and borrower APR. Finally i displayed the interaction between term and Estimated Return for loan amount.
